Things 2 Do
- First repo init
- - Set up rspec
- Class
- Balance constant
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Interpolation
- Print


What Did We Learn About the Output?

- First line should always be "date || credit || debit || balance"
- THEN
- - Chronological listing of all transactions
- - String interpolation going '#{date} + " || "+ #{credit} + " || "+ #{debit} + " || "+ {balance}'
- - If a value it simply needs to be left blank

THINGS TO NOTE
- If there is nothing there the string interpolation needs to take a space (or we add them in in the return process)
- Everything does not need to line up

QUESTIONS FOR CLIENT
- What happens if they go negative
- - Not listed so just allow it
- Would the print out be the end of the program?
- - Did not answer so just let it continue

QUESTIONS FOR KATERINA
- Should I ever show leave these notes in the actual folder so that the tester can see them
- - Yes and clearly labelled in the README.md
- I understand I can ask clarifying questions but should i over burden them or just send them all at once
- - Most of the information should be in what they send you so unless its vague look at it again
- Should you ever build out extra features in a tech test if you have time
- - No stick to the spec but it might be a good idea to go into the interviews with ideas
- Does anyone put stock in how quickly something is finished (I imagine not)
- - No they look at code quality over everything
- Any good repository of a lot of these type of things
- - Makers has a repo of these but not really (find your own)
